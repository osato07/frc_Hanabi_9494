        <p class="ja nico marge">The FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC) is the world's largest roboticsbr<br>
            competition, attracting over 100,000 participants. As of February 2024, <br>
            it has brought together more than 3,200 teams from 26 countries. <br>
            Competitors design and build their own robots to compete in this event.</p>
        <p class="ja nico bigmarge"> The non-profit organization based in the United States,<br>
            FIRST® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology),<br>
            operates various events, including the FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC). <br>
            This organization is dedicated to providing a platform for young people to engage with <br>
            and learn about robotics engineering, championing the philosophy of "More Than Robots." <br>
            This phrase signifies FIRST®'s goal to not only focus on technological education and <br>
            competition but also to foster human qualities such as teamwork, creativity,<br> 
            and leadership through these activities.</p>

        <!-- <img class="three marge" src="Material/JP-FRC/hanabi_navy.png" alt=""> -->
        <p class="ja nico marge">The robots constructed for the competition are challenging to build individually,<br>
            with dimensions reaching up to 1 meter in width and length and weighing as much as 50 kilograms. <br>
            Teams have approximately 6 weeks to complete these large robots after the competition rules are released. <br>
            The competition format is 3 teams against 3 teams, with team combinations being randomized. <br>
            Participating teams range from beginners to veterans. <br>
            Technically, tools used by professional engineers, <br>
            as well as programming languages like Java and C, are employed. <br>
            English is essential for the competition, facilitating communication with teams <br>
            from different countries and understanding the rules. <br>
            The nature of the competition varies widely, with rules changing annually, <br>
            requiring flexible thinking and creativity.</p>

        <p class="ja nico marge">Outreach activities, or community service, play a crucial role in thebr    
            FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC). <br>
            Among the various awards in FRC, the Chairman's Award stands as the most prestigious. Winning this award grants the right to compete in the world championships, <br>
            regardless of the team's performance in robot competitions. <br><br>
            The Chairman's Award is presented to teams that conduct <br>
            outreach activities in alignment with FIRST®'s values. <br>
            Our team aims for this award as part of our activities. <br>
            FRC should not be considered just another robotics competition. <br>
            Beyond hardware and programming, FRC encompasses presenting, <br>
            creating slides and documents, securing sponsorships with companies, and crowdfunding, among others. <br>
            It's a robotics competition that transcends the usual confines, incorporating a variety of elements. <br>

            <p class="ja nico marge">This text outlines the importance of fundraising for participation in the <br>
                FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC) in 2024, <br><br>
                detailing the costs involved such as <br>
                competition entry fees (approximately 800,000 yen),<br>
                robot creation expenses (approximately 500,000 yen),<br>
                and travel expenses (approximately 3,000,000 yen). <br>
                Additional costs for participating in the World Championships include extra entry fees (approximately 1,000,000 yen) and further travel expenses (approximately 3,000,000 yen). <br>
                It emphasizes that all these funds need to be raised independently. <br><br>
                The Hanabi team has engaged in fundraising through sponsorship agreements. <br>
